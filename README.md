What I'm currently working on - Business Forecasting 
-Currently i am working on forecasting inflation rate of a country by determining the past trends and using the past values to forecast the following years inflation rate. Inflation rate affects various part of our daily lives, it affects everyone from a small business owner to a huge conglomerate. By forecasting the inflation rate, economists and policy makers whose job is to aid take decisions as to promote stable prices need accurate forecasts in order to monitor inflation and make necessary corrections when needed.
-This forecast's outcome will be a point specific outcome. 
-While forecasting we need to measure the accuracy of that forecast before we can use it, to do so we will be using MAPE.
-The data that we will be using to forecast is referred from the data collected and curated by The World Bank organization. One can easyily find the data at https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG
